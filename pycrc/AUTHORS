Thomas Pircher: main developer.

Matthias Urlichs: removed the unused 'direct' parameter and added a fix not to
    recurse into main() when an unknown algorithm is selected.

Marti Raudsepp: improved spacin for the table-driven algorithm.

Stephan Brumme: his implementation of the slice-by-x algorithm was used as a
    basis for the implementation in pycrc.

Danjel McGougan: whose Universal Crc project was highly influential in the
    implementation of widths < 8 in the table-driven algorithm.
