pycrc is a free, easy to use Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculator and C
source code generator.



System Requirements
===================

pycrc requires Python 2.6 or later. Python 3.x is supported.
The last version compatible with Python 2.4 is pycrc v0.7.10.



Installation
============

This program doesn't need any particular installation. The script can be
called from any directory.
Simply call the python interpreter with the script as parameter:

    python pycrc.py [options]

On UNIX-like systems, you might want to make the script executable:

    chmod +x pycrc.py

Then the script can be called like an application.

    ./pycrc.py [options]

If you get an error "No such file or directory" when running ./pycrc.py then
make sure the file is saved in UNIX file endings:

    dos2unix pycrc.py

Copyright of the generated source code
======================================

Prior to v0.6, pycrc was released under the GPL and an additional addition to
the licence was required to permit to use the generated source code in products
with a OSI unapproved licence. As of version 0.6, pycrc is released under the
terms of the MIT licence and such an additional clause to the licence is no
more required.
The code generated by pycrc is not considered a substantial portion of the
software, therefore the licence does not cover the generated code, and the
author of pycrc will not claim any copyright on the generated code.
